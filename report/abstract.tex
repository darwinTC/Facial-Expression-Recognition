\chapter*{Abstract}
Facial expressions are a means of nonverbal communication that show emotions of people, these expressions help interpersonal transmit information and facilitate the understanding of the meaning of spoken language. So that we believe that to determine the facial expression would be a rich source of information for later use. The objective of this project is to simulate the behavior our brains to recognize images of facial expressions using one of the techniques of Deep Learning, achieving a machine can learn from images of facial expressions supplied sample (training data) in order to classify future examples, without any human intervention in the process. Nowadays thanks to the technique used in this project (convolutional neural network) researchers are achieving good results in image recognition, object detection, understanding scene, compared with other conventional techniques, so in this project use the basic architecture of a convolutional neural network to recognize facial expressions, and classified into 6 categories: happiness, sadness, joy, fear, anger and surprise. This paper give us more understanding on convolutional neural network applied to the recognition of facial expressions and images in general also help in the development of future project requiring the recognition of facial expressions like systems man-machine interaction, marketing analysis based on the facial expressions of people, behavioral studies, mental health and cognitive processes.
